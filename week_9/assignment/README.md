# COMP 482 
## AB1  2023 Nov 1 Assignment 3 

Use youâ€™re the given PDF articles from UFV Today blog and the given ppmi.py code to calculate the term-term matrix with PPMI measure (pg. 117 of Speech and Language Processing), but only for three words in the vocabulary of the ten PDF articles of your choice against three context words of your choice. Your choices should demonstrate some small text analysis that result in matches for some positive counts. Use your own judgement for what analysis will work for you and give brief reasoning in the comments of your program.

Use the rows of your matrix as embedding vectors and calculate the cosine similarity between them pairwise (pg. 113).  

Submit zipped folder with code and subfolder of PDFs by Monday, Nov 6, before 5 pm.
